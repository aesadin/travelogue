# Travelogue

## Kate Skorija

### Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Travelogue will be a visual resource for users to keep track of places they’ve been, and places they would like to go. I would like it to have an analog sort of feel, like looking at an old globe or map and daydreaming about far away places.  I would like to focus on UI/UX, and really make it engaging/interesting for the user to look around and pin places.

### MVP:

*  Users can navigate a world map easily (zoom, pan, etc).
*  Users can place pins on the map with a click, to mark places they’ve been and add places they would like to go.
*  Users can create a login and view their previously placed pins once logged in.

### Stretch Goals: 
*  Users can click on a placed pin and create/read/update/delete notes for that place (what to see/what they have seen, restaurants, people they met or traveled with, etc.).
*  Users can upload local photos to the places they have been, so they can look back on travel memories.
*  Users can access a user dashboard where they can browse their places in list form, and search through their notes.

*  JavaScript
